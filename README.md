## 🔗 Orchestration (Low-Code)
*The control center for connecting APIs and AI agents.*

* **[n8n](https://n8n.io/)** - The absolute best for workflow automation. Fair-code, self-hostable, and handles complex logic better than Zapier.
* **[Flowise](https://flowiseai.com/)** - specific drag-and-drop tool for building LLM apps (Chatbots, RAG). Great for quick prototyping.
* **[LangFlow](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow)** - A UI for LangChain, allowing you to visualize complex Python agent logic.

## 🐍 Agent Frameworks (Pro-Code)
*Python libraries for building custom, high-complexity agents.*

* **[CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/)** - Framework for orchestrating role-playing autonomous agents. Great for "Team" based architectures.
* **[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)** - The industry standard for chaining LLM calls. Complex but powerful.
* **[PydanticAI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai)** - A newer, cleaner way to build agents using standard Python data validation.
* **[AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/)** - Microsoft's framework for multi-agent conversation and collaboration.

## 🧠 The "Brains" (LLM Inference)
*Where to get the intelligence.*

* **[Groq](https://groq.com/)** - The fastest inference engine on the market. Essential for real-time voice or chat agents (Llama 3 speeds are insane).
* **[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)** - A unified API to access ALL models (Claude, GPT-4, Llama) with one key. Best for testing.
* **[Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)](https://www.anthropic.com/)** - Currently the best model for *coding* and complex reasoning tasks.

## 👀 The "Eyes" (Web Scraping for AI)
*Tools specifically designed to turn websites into Clean Markdown for LLMs.*

* **[Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/)** - Converts any website into clean Markdown/JSON. Perfect for RAG data ingestion.
* **[Crawl4AI](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai)** - An open-source, async web crawler for LLMs. Fast and free.
* **[ScrapeGraphAI](https://github.com/VinciGit00/Scrapegraph-ai)** - Python library that uses LLMs to scrape websites based on natural language instructions.

## 💾 The "Memory" (Vector DBs & RAG)
*Storing knowledge for your agents.*

* **[Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)** - The standard managed vector database. Serverless option is great for starters.
* **[ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/)** - Open-source, embedding database. Best for running **locally** on your machine.
* **[Supabase (pgvector)](https://supabase.com/)** - If you already use Postgres, this is the best way to add vector search.

## 🔒 Local AI & Privacy
*Running models on your own hardware (Zero Cost).*

* **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** - The easiest way to run Llama 3, Mistral, and Gemma locally on Mac/Linux/Windows.
* **[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)** - A nice UI for downloading and running quantized models (GGUF format).
